by Thomas M. Fullerton, Jr., Michael Pokojovy, Andrews T. Anum and Ebenezer Nkum.

Instructions:

1) The "simulation/simulation_I" folder includes Matlab programs used to perform simulation study and generate graphs and tables reported in Simulation Setting I (Section 3.1.1). See "simulation/simulation_I/readme". 

2) The "simulation/simulation_II" folder includes Matlab programs used to perform simulation study and generate graphs and tables reported in Simulation Setting II (Section 3.1.2). See "simulation/simulation_II/readme".

3) The "examples/daily_treasury" folder includes Matlab programs to perform the analysis in Section 3.2.1 (Daily Treasury and Euro Par Yields). See "examples/daily_treasury/readme" for details. 

4) The "examples/safehaven" folder includes Matlab programs to perform the analysis in Section 3.2.2 (Commodities and Currencies). See "examples/safehaven/readme" for details.
