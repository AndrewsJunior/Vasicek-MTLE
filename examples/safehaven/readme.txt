Instructions:

1) Run safehavenplots to plot the log-volatilities of the assets.

2) Run Test_safehaven to perform the analysis in Section 3.2.2 (Safe Haven Assets).

Please request the safe haven dataset from the authors of "A discussion on the robust vector autoregressive models: novel evidence from safe haven assets. Annals of Operations Research, 339(3), 1725â€“1755."
